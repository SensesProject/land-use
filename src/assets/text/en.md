# The role of land for food production and climate protection

Today, a large share of the global ice-free land is used by humans for agriculture and forestry, which provide food and timber for more than 7 Billion People. However, currently prevailing practices in agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) have negative impacts on climate change, biodiversity, desertification and land degradation.

+++ intro 2

We start this module by explaining the causes and consequences of increasing pressure on land during the last decades. Subsequently, we take a look into the future of land use and its consequences, based on scenarios from the [IPCC SRCCL](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/). In these forward looking scenarios, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by AFOLU and land-based Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) play a central role to mitigate climate change. Therefore, land management in these scenarios is an important component of the overall emissions reduction. But land is a finite resource. This scarcity can result in trade-offs between land-based mitigation at large-scale and food security. We close this module with an outlook on a more sustainable mitigation pathway towards 1.5°C that minimzes such trade-offs through early action, lifestyle changes and regulatory policies.

## Land Is Under Pressure

Since the 1960s the world population more than doubled (factor 2.5), while the per-capita income tripled in the same period. Both factors, population and income, substantially increased the demand for agricultural products in the last decades. While higher population increases the demand directly, higher incomes shift the dietary patterns away from crops and vegetables towards animal-based products, which are more resource-intensive. Today, about 60-80% of all agricultural land is used for livestock production, either for livestock grazing on pasture or for growing feed on cropland.

+++ pressure 1

### Population and Income

Growing population and higher per-capita incomes have been key drivers of the rising pressure on land in the last decades.

+++ pressure 2

### Calorie supply

Higher per-capita incomes increase the per-capita calorie intake and shift the dietary patterns towards meat and dairy products.

+++ pressure 3

### Demand

Higher per-capita calorie intake combined with a growing population increases the global demand for crops and livestock products.

+++ pressure 4

### Prices

While prices for agricultural products fluctuate, for many products, there is also an overall increase reflecting the increased demand.

+++ pressure 5

### Household Expenditure

But rising prices did not keep up with rising incomes. The actual household expenditure shares for crops and livestock products decreased.

+++ pressure 6

### Land Cover

A key insight is that higher production of agricultural commodities since 1965 was largely achieved by higher intensity of land use and only to a small extent by further expansion of cropland and pasture area, which was the pre-dominant mode of increasing production until then. This higher intensity in land use is the central contributor for already heightened pressure on land. 

+++ pressure 7

### Yields

Substantial yield increases since the 1960s have been facilitated by the green revolution, which includes new breeds of high yield crops, irrigation, fertilization and the use of pesticides. 

+++ pressure 8

### Agricultural Inputs

The gains in productivity since the 1960s were only made possible by strong irrigation and in particular fertilisation.

+++ pressure 9

### Emissions

GHG emissions from AFOLU show increasing trends for nitrous oxide (N₂O) and methane (CH₄) since the 1960s, which reflect the tremendous increase in the use of industrial nitrogen fertilizer and the substantical increase of livestock production (enteric fermentation).

## Potentials and trade-offs of land-based mitigation

The AFOLU sector is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions today. The future trajectory of AFOLU GHG emissions depends on various factors including technological, social and economic developments (e.g. population and dietary patterns). Moreover, the AFOLU sector can play an important role for climate change mitigation through land-based Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) options such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and afforestation. 
In the following we show land use and AFOLU GHG emissions for a «no climate policy» scenario (SSP2-Baseline) and a 1.5°C pathway (SSP2-19) from the [IPCC 1.5°C database](https://data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/iamc-1.5c-explorer/).

+++ solution 1

Today, @purple(AFOLU) is responsible for about 12% of total annual anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, most of which are caused by deforestation. For other greenhouse gases, AFOLU's share is larger. AFOLU accounts for 46% of total CH₄ and 73% of total N₂O emissions, globally. CH₄ emissions are primarily caused by rice and livestock production. N₂O emissions are largely caused by synthetic fertilizer application.

+++ solution 2

In absolute numbers, CH₄ and N₂O emissions seem very small compared to CO₂ emissions. But the contribution of these GHGs to climate change is substantially higher than that of CO₂. The global warming potential over a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) of 1 ton CH₄/N₂O is equivalent to 28/265 tons of CO₂.

+++ solution 3

For that reason, it makes sense to refer to CO₂-equivalents when comparing GHGs. In this metric it becomes clear that  CH₄ and N₂O emissions from @purple(AFOLU) are far from negligible.

+++ solution 4

In the following comparison across scenarios, we'll stick to CO₂-equivalents.

+++ solution 5

In the «no climate policy» scenario (SSP2-Baseline), in which no policies for climate mitigation are implemented, @yellow no(total) annual anthropogenic CO₂ emissions (including all sectors) continue to rise. Contrary to this trend, CO₂ emissions from @purple(AFOLU) drop below zero by the end of the century as a result of reduced deforestation and some afforestation. However, CH₄ and N₂0 emissions, which are linked to food production and land management, continue to rise in the no climate policy scenario.

+++ solution 6

In the 1.5°C pathway (SSP2-1.9), @purple(AFOLU) plays a pivotal role in turning @yellow(total) CO₂ emissions net-negative by 2100, achieved via large-scale afforestation and BECCS. CH₄ and N₂0 emissions from AFOLU are substantially reduced by technical mitigation and/or behavioural change towards diets with less animal products. However, non-CO₂ AFOLU emissions can't be eliminated in full because they are inherent to agricultural production. In sum over all GHGs, AFOLU is a sink of 1171 Mt CO₂-equivalents in 2100.

+++ cdr 0

While BECCS and afforestation have high potentials for @green(CDR), they require substantial amounts of @red(land) and @blue(water). Other land-based CDR options such as soil carbon storage and biochar have lower potentials but also require much less @red(land) and @blue(water). However, the most up-to-date transformation pathways, including those shown here, mostly rely on BECCS and afforestation, which are both land-demanding CDR options. 

+++ cdr 1

Land-use change differs substantially between the no climate policy scenario and the 1.5°C pathway.

+++ change 0

In the no climate policy scenario, agricultural land (including dedicated @orange(bioenergy crops)) expands by about 600 Mha between 2005 and 2100 (corresponding to a relative increase of about 12%) at the cost of @blue(forests) and @purple(other natural land). The main driver for the expansion of agricultural land is increased @yellow(crop) and @green(livestock) production, and to some extent biomass production used as substitute for fossil fuel in the energy system. 

+++ change 1

The dynamics in the 1.5°C pathway differ in several aspects. First, land used for agricultural production declines to allow for large-scale @blue(afforestation) of about 700 Mha globally by 2100. At the same time, 750 Mha of land are dedicated to @orange(2nd generation bioenergy crop) production in 2100. Therefore, the area available for food production is substantially reduced in the 1.5°C pathway. 

+++ change 2

Production of bioenergy in the @neon(1.5°C pathway) is about 4 times higher compared to the @red(no climate policy scenario) in 2100, and mostly used in combination with CCS in the energy system, which results in large-scale CDR of more than 10 Gt CO2 per year. 

+++ change 3

But with more land dedicated land-based CDR and less land available for food production, food prices rise, which threatens food security. Therefore, the @neon(1.5°C pathway) comes with a trade-off between land-based CDR for meeting the Paris Agreement goals and the broader Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Agenda.

+++ change 4

Furthermore, a high-level implementation of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) may also pose risks of desertification, land degradation, and countering adaptation measures.

## Is it possible to reach the Paris Agreement goals without major trade-offs in the AFOLU sector?

The 1.5°C pathway presented above is compatible with the Paris Agreement goals but comes with a trade-off regarding food security. Therefore, the question arises if it is possible to minimize such unwanted trade-offs. In this context, dietary patterns play an important role, because the production of animal-based food products is land-demanding. Therefore, a shift of dietary patterns towards less animal-based food products could reduce the overall pressure in the AFOLU sector, which would be of particular advantage in a mitigation pathway with land-based CDR. 
Below we show a different set of scenarios consisting of a @neon(default mitigation policy) (similar to the 1.5°C pathway, but run by a different model) and a @green(sustainable mitigation policy). The sustainable mitigation policy pathway includes the political dimension (early political action, regulatory policies) but also lifestyle changes, such as shifts in dietary patterns.

+++ sustainable 1

### Demand-side mitigation

A key component of the @green(sustainable scenario) is lifestyle change like reduced demand for livestock products and reduced food waste. In consequence, the area needed for agricultural production is smaller in the @green(sustainable scenario), which reduces the pressure on land. 

+++ sustainable 2

### Land-based mitigation

As a result of less land needed for agricultural production, the @green(sustainable scenario) shows more afforestation and less bioenergy, which makes sense considering that afforestation as CDR option is cheaper than BECCS.

+++ sustainable 3

### Emissions

More afforestation and less bioenergy in the @green(sustainable pathway) is reflected in AFOLU CO₂ emissions and carbon sequestration from biomass. Moreover, the @green(sustainable mitigation pathway) with less livestock production and reduced food waste shows much lower CH₄ and N₂O emissions from AFOLU compared to the @neon(default mitigation pathway).

+++ sustainable 4

### Prices

The reduced pressure on land in the @green(sustainable scenario) is reflected in the development of food prices. While food prices in the @neon(default mitigation pathway) rise by factors of about 1.5-3 throughout the 21st century, food prices in the @green(sustainable scenario) remain rather constant or increase only slightly. Therefore, the trade-off between land-based CDR and food security is reduced in the @green(sustainable scenario). 

+++ conclusion

## Conclusion

Today, about 70% of the global ice-free land is used by humans for agriculture and forestry to produce food, material and biomass. In mitigation pathways compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement, land-based CDR plays a pivotal role, in particular afforestation and BECCS. This additional demand for land could result in trade-offs with other sustainable development goals (SDGs) such as food security or biodiversity protection. But as we have seen it is possible to substantially reduce such unwanted trade-offs if early mitigation action is embedded in a broader sustainability policy.
