# Transition to Sustainable Land-Use

Today, most of the global ice-free land is used by humans in some way or another. Land-use change and sustainable land management play an integral part in climate change adaptation and mitigation. But they also have an impact on food security, desertification, and land degradation.

+++ intro 2

In this module, we first show how changing socioeconomics affected land use in recent decades. We then demonstrate the potentials of land-use change to mitigate climate change. But also its limitations and potential trade-offs. Finally, we emphasise the need for sustainable land solutions.

## Land Is Under Pressure

Demand for food is rising and so that for land to produce food on. But land is ultimately a finite resource, which heightens the pressure on it and the need for increased productivity.

+++ pressure 1

### Population and Income

At the core of rising pressure on land lie population and income growth, the latter leading to higher living standards and higher calorie intake per capita.

+++ pressure 2

### Calorie supply

Per capita calorie supply from fish – which only impacts land use indirectly – almost doubled. But the increase from livestock and secondary products, like dairy, oils, and refined sugars, is also remarkable.

+++ pressure 3

### Demand

Higher calory intake combined with a growing population increases the global demand for these resources. Indirectly they also increase the demand for feed and supply chain loss.

+++ pressure 4

### Prices

While prices for agricultural products fluctuate, for many products, there is also an overall increase reflecting the heightened demand.

+++ pressure 5

### Household Expenditure

But rising prices did not keep up with rising incomes. The actual household expenditure shares for crops and livestock products decreased.

+++ pressure 6

### Land Cover

Land being a limited resource, the rising demand can hardly be met, by increasing cropland and pastures. Except for managed forests and urban areas, which both are quite low in absolute numbers, land-use changes remain modest.

+++ pressure 7

### Yields

Increased yields make it possible to meet the growing demand nonetheless.

+++ pressure 8

### Productivity

This gain in productivity was only made possible by irrigation and – to a far greater extent – fertilisation.

+++ pressure 9

### Emissions

All that also reflects in emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), most notably in the increased N₂O Emissions which are a direct consequence of increased fertilisation.

## Land Is Part of the Solution

Agriculture and land-use change are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. But they also play a significant role in terms of climate change mitigation.

+++ solution 1

Today AFOLU is responsible for about 12% of total annual CO₂ emissions, most of which are caused by deforestation. For other greenhouse gases, AFOLU's share is larger: Methane (CH₄), caused primarily by rice and livestock production and nitrous oxide (N₂O), by synthetic fertilizer application account for 46% and 73% respectively.

+++ solution 2

In absolute numbers, there are vast differences across these gases. But the extent to which they contribute to climate change also differs. CH₄ has about 28 times and N₂O 265 times the global warming potential CO₂ has.

+++ solution 3

For that reason, it makes sense to refer to CO₂-equivalents when comparing greenhouse gases. Here it becomes clear that while still lower than CO₂, emissions from CH₄ and N₂O are far from neglectable.

+++ solution 4

So, for now, while comparing emissions across scenarios, we'll stick to CO₂-equivalents.

+++ solution 5

In the SSP2-Baseline scenario, total emissions continue to rise across the board. Contrary to this trend, CO₂ emissions from AFOLU are below zero by the end of the century. But not enough to make up for the still rising CH₄ and N₂0 emissions.

+++ solution 6

In the SSP2-1.9 Scenario, AFOLU has to play a pivotal role in bringing total CO₂ emissions below zero. Since CH₄ and N₂0 emissions are inherent to agriculture, they can't be eliminated. But they still need to be cut down by half. Summed up this would put emissions from AFOLU at -1171 Mt CO₂-equivalents.

+++ cdr 0

Strategies to reduce emissions from AFOLU entail measures on the demand and the supply side. For instance, CH₄ and N₂O AFOLU emissions can be reduced by behavioural change towards diets with fewer animal products or by technical mitigation options, or by a combination of both. Reduction of AFOLU CO₂ emissions can be achieved by less deforestation. Also, land can be used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (CDR or negative emission technologies), e.g. via afforestation or BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage). Land-based CDR options have substantially different characteristics in terms of CDR potential, land, water and energy requirements as well as costs. 

+++ cdr 1

BECCS and afforestation, which show the most potential for CDR require much land. Returning to the SSP2-Baseline and SSP2-19 scenarios, we can explore what that means exactly.

+++ change 0

Following the emissions chart we showed earlier, land use changes remain moderate in the SSP2-Baseline scenario. While bioenergy crops gain relevance and effectively help to lower CO₂ emissions, more land for overall agriculture to the cost of other natural land keeps CH₄ and N₂O Emissions rising.

+++ change 1

SSP2-1.9 requires land-use changes at a far larger scale. Here, much more land is needed for bioenergy crops and afforestation, drastically reducing the land area available for food production.

+++ change 2

Production of bioenergy increases, and as carbon sequestration unfolds its potential in the second half of the century, AFOLU aids in achieving negative emissions.

+++ change 3

But with less land available for food production, food security declines and food prices rise. 

+++ change 4

Furthermore, a high-level implementation of BECCS is also posing risks of desertification, land degradation, and countering adaptation measures.

+++ sustainable 0

## Land Solutions Need to Be Sustainable

The repercussions of having less land area available for food production depend on socioeconomic factors – mainly population development and diets. For that, we turn to a different scenario set consisting of a default policy (similar to SSP2-19, but run by a different model) and sustainable one, including early action, lifestyle and regulation policies.

+++ sustainable 1

### Land-based mitigation

The default policy scenario favours BECCS over Afforestatation despite the risks associated with it. After all, it requires less land area and also contributes to energy production for which this default policy scenario also has a higher demand.

+++ sustainable 2

### Demand-side mitigation

A key component of the sustainable scenarios is lifestyle changes like lowering the demand for livestock products and a reduction of food waste. That means there is less area needed for food production, allowing for more afforestation.

+++ sustainable 3

### Emissions

The lower demand for food products also shows in agricultural CH₄ and N₂O emissions. While it takes a while for BECCS to pick up in either scenario, the significant afforestation also boosts CO₂ sequestration in the sustainable one.

+++ sustainable 4

### Prices

Similarly, with lower demand and less food waste, food security is not at that much risk, meaning that prices for crops stay roughly at today's level and the cost of livestock products increases only slightly.

+++ conclusion

## Conclusion

Land-use change plays a significant role in achieving emission goals and mitigating climate change. But land-use is also closely connected to other environmental and societal issues. An aggressive shift towards BECCS has negative implications on biodiversity, desertification, land degradation and food security. A change in demand for food and land management are fundamental for a successful transition to sustainable land-use.
